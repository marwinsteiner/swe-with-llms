  - Throughput expectations (e.g., 1000 requests/second)
  - Concurrent user capacity (e.g., 10,000 simultaneous users)

- Availability Requirements
  - Uptime target (e.g., 99.9%)
  - Maintenance windows
  - Recovery time objectives (RTO)
  - Recovery point objectives (RPO)

- Resource Limitations

```

### 3. Security Requirements
```markdown

## How to Define Requirements 🎯

1. **Start with Business Needs**
   ```markdown
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who are your users?
   - What's your expected scale?
   - What's your budget?
   ```

2. **Define Performance Expectations**
   ```markdown
   - How fast should it be?
   - How many users?
   - How much data?
   - What's acceptable downtime?
   ```

3. **Consider Constraints**
   ```markdown
   - Development resources
   - Production environment
   - Budget limitations
   - Time constraints
   ```

4. **Security & Compliance**
   ```markdown
   - What data are you handling?
   - What regulations apply?
   - What security level needed?
   ```

## Prompt for Requirements Generation

```markdown
Based on the following project context:

Business Context:
[Describe your business case]

Scale Requirements:
- Expected users: [number]
- Data volume: [size]
- Transaction volume: [number]

Environment Details:
- Development: [specs]
- Production: [platform/specs]

Security Needs:
- Data sensitivity: [level]
- Compliance requirements: [standards]

Budget Constraints:
- Development budget: [amount]
- Operational budget: [amount]

Please generate a comprehensive technical requirements document following the template structure above, ensuring all requirements are:
- Specific and measurable
- Realistic within constraints
- Aligned with business needs
- Technically feasible
```

Remember:
- Technical requirements are about WHAT the system needs to do, not HOW it will do it
- They should be measurable and verifiable
- They form the basis for architecture decisions
- They should align with business goals and constraints
